# Blog-Website

This is the initial version of a working blog-website.
It lets you compose new posts and view the published posts on seperate routes.


## Local Installation
1. Clone this repo to your local system
2. Install all the dependencies required for this project using npm install
3. npm start will run the server using nodemon (if you have it installed globally in your local system)
4. Open the app in localhost:3000

NOTE: To add new posts, use the following route -> localhost:3000/compose


## What to do next ??
This app for now has no database connected, hence the immediate update will be connecting to MongoDB and retrieve posts using the same.
Next, implement Authentication and Security and hence enable User-Signup and User-login.
